Backend Development...
Back end Development refers to the server-side development
Back end developer skills include Development Languages Database
Backend engineer should know at least one server-side or Backend programming language like Java, Python, Ruby, c#, JavaScript etc.

What is SERVER?
A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services,
server are able to accept request and send response...

To develop a server need a server side programming languages
These languages help to develop a server that contain the business logic, process the data.
and help to save data on server or database.

Introduction to Backend Development with Node.js

Node.js is a popular runtime environment that allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, making it fast and efficient.

Node.js is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it suitable for building scalable and high-performance applications. It supports a wide range of libraries and frameworks, such as Express.js, which simplify the development process.


Node.js is used for developing various types of applications, including web servers, APIs, and real-time applications. Its package manager, npm (Node Package Manager), provides a vast ecosystem of modules and packages that can be easily integrated into your projects.

By using Node.js, backend developers can create robust and scalable servers, manage databases, and implement business logic, all using a single programming language: JavaScript.


Non-blocking: When Node.js needs to do something slow, like reading a file or talking to a database, it doesn't wait for the slow task to finish. Instead, it starts the task and then moves on to do other things

We are using Express.js to develop the server and MongoDB for the database.
But First We learn fundamentals of Node.js and create our server on Node.js without any frameworks
